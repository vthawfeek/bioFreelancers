## Expertise
I'm a computational biologist with over ten years of research experience in analysing complex biological data and insider knowledge of various bioinformatics databases. Along with data analysis skills, I have acquired various skills on curation, annotation, wrangling and integration of data from several years of work at biomedical databases.	I have successfully collaborated with interdisciplinary scientists and teams to introduce novel website features and publish scientific papers.

## Services
My skillset in applied mathematics including mathematical modelling and some statistical analysis can be useful to a wide range of services.
